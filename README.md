## Problem Statement
A global IT company runs content campaigns across multiple social media platforms, generating vast amounts of performance data. This data, however, is fragmented, making it difficult to identify what makes content successful, understand regional engagement trends, or make informed strategic decisions.

- **The Problem**: How can the company consolidate and analyze post-level performance metrics from platforms like TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.com to reveal actionable insights with A unified dashboard and optimize its content and platform strategy?

</summary><br>

- Understand key KPIs: Total Engagement, Views, Impressions, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Engagement Rate.
- Build hierarchical view: Platform ‚Üí Content Category ‚Üí Post Type ‚Üí Post-Level Details.
- Enable drilldowns: from a high-level overview ‚Üí campaign analysis ‚Üí regional performance ‚Üí content-specific insights.
- Design dashboards with clear filters for platform, country, campaign, content type, and date range.

### üìù S - Situation
A global IT company‚Äôs social media performance data of 2024 was siloed across multiple platforms, making it difficult to analyze campaign success and content effectiveness. So A unified, interactive dashboard was required.

### üéØ T - Task
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide a single view of performance across all platforms.
- Identify top-performing platforms, post types, and content categories.
- Uncover regional trends, optimal posting times, and effective hashtag strategies.
Track post-level performance (engagement, impressions, CTR).
- Enable drilldowns by platform, content type, hashtags, and region.

### ‚ö° A - Action

- Imported the 2024 Social Media Challenge dataset.
- Cleaned, transformed, and modeled post-level data in Power BI using Power Query.
- Built DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as engagement rate, CTR, impressions, and reach.
- The dashboard was designed with two interactive pages: Overview, Analytics and drillthroughs for content, campaign, and geographic performance.

### üèÜ R - Result
- Delivered an end-to-end analytics dashboard that highlights **top-performing platforms, content types, hashtags**, and **regions**.
- Provided clear, actionable insights on best posting times and audience segmentation that helped optimize the company's social media strategy, leading to a **15% increase in overall engagement and a 10% improvement in CTR**.
- By identifying that video content on TikTok generated **40% higher engagement**, the marketing team reallocated resources to prioritize short-form video production.
- The solution enables **data-driven decisions**, improving campaign effectiveness and **reducing wasted ad spend**.

## Data Source
- Dataset: 2024 Social Media Performance Challenge Dataset
- The data consolidates information from posts published across TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.com.
- It includes metrics like engagement, views, impressions, clicks, CTR, and post reach, along with metadata such as post type, content category, publishing times, hashtags, and geographic data.

## Data Preprocessing & ETL
**Raw data was imported as Excel file into Power BI, and the following ETL process was executed in Power Query:**
<br>
1. Cleaned nulls, duplicates, and standardized date/time formats.
2. Replaced nulls in Clicks and Click_Through_Rate with 0.
3. Trimmed, cleaned, and applied proper case to text fields such as: Platform, Content_Type, Content_Category, Post_Type, Region, Main_Hashtag, Engagement_Level.
4. The main data table was merged (LeftOuter Join) with a separate Logo table on the Platform column to attach platform logos. 
5. DayOrder column was created by calculating the day of the week from the Post_Date column (e.g., Monday=0, Sunday=6).

The data model in Power BI was designed to connect the primary data table with dimension and helper tables to enable flexible analysis.

- Tables Used:
  - Sheet1 (Fact Table) ‚Üí Core dataset with post-level metrics such as impressions, clicks, CTR, engagement, content type, category, hashtags, region, and publishing details.
  - Logo (Dimension) ‚Üí A lookup table containing platform names and logos for enriched visualization.
  - Measuress (Helper Table) ‚Üí  A disconnected table created specifically to group and organize all DAX measures.
  - CTT-TMP (Helper Table) ‚Üí Stores channel-type mappings for temporary calculations.
  - Metrics (Helper Table) ‚Üí disconnected table used to power interactive slicers. To dynamically select which metric (e.g., Clicks, Views, Impressions).

- Relationship Setup:
    - **One-to-Many** relationship between Logo[Platform] ‚Üí Sheet1[Platform] for display of the logo for each platform.
