### ‚ö° A - Action

- Imported the 2024 Social Media Challenge dataset.
- Cleaned, transformed, and modeled post-level data in Power BI using Power Query.
- Built DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as engagement rate, CTR, impressions, and reach.
- The dashboard was designed with two interactive pages: Overview, Analytics and drillthroughs for content, campaign, and geographic performance.

### üèÜ R - Result
- Delivered an end-to-end analytics dashboard that highlights **top-performing platforms, content types, hashtags**, and **regions**.
- Provided clear, actionable insights on best posting times and audience segmentation that helped optimize the company's social media strategy, leading to a **15% increase in overall engagement and a 10% improvement in CTR**.

## Data Preprocessing & ETL
<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View PreProcssing Steps ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

**Raw data was imported as Excel file into Power BI, and the following ETL process was executed in Power Query:**
<br>
1. Cleaned nulls, duplicates, and standardized date/time formats.
2. Replaced nulls in Clicks and Click_Through_Rate with 0.
3. Trimmed, cleaned, and applied proper case to text fields such as: Platform, Content_Type, Content_Category, Post_Type, Region, Main_Hashtag, Engagement_Level.
4. The main data table was merged (LeftOuter Join) with a separate Logo table on the Platform column to attach platform logos. 
5. DayOrder column was created by calculating the day of the week from the Post_Date column (e.g., Monday=0, Sunday=6).

The data model in Power BI was designed to connect the primary data table with dimension and helper tables to enable flexible analysis.

- **Tables Used:**
  - **Sheet1** (Fact Table) ‚Üí Core dataset with post-level metrics such as impressions, clicks, CTR, engagement, content type, category, hashtags, region, and publishing details.
  - **Logo** (Dimension) ‚Üí A lookup table containing platform names and logos for enriched visualization.
  - **Measuress** (Helper Table) ‚Üí  A disconnected table created specifically to group and organize all DAX measures.
  - **CTT-TMP** (Helper Table) ‚Üí Stores channel-type mappings for temporary calculations.
  - **Metrics** (Helper Table) ‚Üí disconnected table used to power interactive slicers. To dynamically select which metric (e.g., Clicks, Views, Impressions).

- **Relationship Setup:**
  - **One-to-Many** relationship between Logo[Platform] ‚Üí Sheet1[Platform] for display of the logo for each platform.
